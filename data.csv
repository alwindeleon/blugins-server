83941,Lockheed Martin ,AMERS,High,"Press release process

1. Go to the portal and look for the release referenced in the E-mail from Lockheed (usually from Dennis Sanchez) . 
*NOTE: even if the client specifically asks for “a URL redirect”, please still steal their release code and build it out in HTML because it’s required for the full text email alert feature. You will redirect AFTER the full text alert has been sent.
2. If the release is in the portal and pending, clean up the release then go to step 4 below.
3. If the release is not pending in the portal, you will need to copy the text from the release URL provided by Lockheed. Please note that if you manually enter the release (pulling the text or code from the WMS Admin e-mail or from Lockheed's corporate site), you will need to fix all of the apostrophes and quotation marks by adjusting them to ""straight"" versions, rather than the curly versions that will come through when copied. I usually past the text in an html editor, update all punctuation and then pasted into the portal when completed. You can always send a test alert to review the release alert. If you do not make these changes, the full-text alert will come through with boxes in place of each of these punctuation marks because of character set issues with the full-text alerts.
4. Once the release is saved, please trigger the alert. MAKE SURE RELEASE TIME AND ALERT TIME MATCH (schedule the release to a later time to do this).
5. Wait for the alert to go out. You can check if it has gone out by looking in the Sent Alert Report or by signing up for the alerts.
6. After triggering the full text alert, please go back into the release and put the URL of the specific release (which you can grab here http://www.lockheedmartin.com/news/index.html) into the overriding URL field and save the release or you can get the link from the email of Lockheed Martin.
